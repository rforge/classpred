		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0

DEPRECATED

    o	Instead of exporting the paired functions, we replaced each
        set with a precomputed object of the Modeler class that
        already combines each pair.  The old functions still exist,
        but are planned to be removed from the namespace in a future
        version.  If you need to call them directly, then you should
        fully qualify them with te class name (e.g.,
        Modeler:::learnLR). 


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Brand new packaging: split out from the CrossVal
        package. Contains the generic support to "learn" and
        "predict". Also contains the base implementations of numerous
        statistical models for classification or regression.
