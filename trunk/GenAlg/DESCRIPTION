Description: This package defines classes and methods that can be used
 to implement genetic algorithms for feature selection.  The idea is
 that we want to select a fixed number of features to combine into a
 linear classifier that can predict a binary outcome, and can use a
 genetic algorithm heuristically to select an optimal set of features.
